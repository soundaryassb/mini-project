# Requirements

## Introduction

These days calculations have become most important to solve any problem in an effective manner and in a easy way without any mistakes. The Calculator application can be used by any bosy in order to calculate easily, effectively accurately.

## Calculator Features and Application 

The features in this application are we can add, substract, divide, multiply, find modulus, find minimum number, maximum number, power of numbers, factorial of a num.

- The System is user friendly.
- The System is efficient and fast in response.
- The System can be customized according to needs.

## Defining our System:

The application focuses on simple mathematical operations

Simple mathematical operations:
- Addition- Integers and real numbers
- Subtraction - Integers and real numbers
- Multiplication â€“ Integers and real numbers
- Division - Real numbers
- Factorial
- min and max value
- modulus

# High and Low Level Requirements

## High Level Requirements


| ID  | Description  | Category  | Status  |
| --- | ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| HR01| Arithimetic Operations | Techinal | TBI |
| HR02| Relational Operations | Technical | TBI |
| HR03| Factorial | technical|TBI|
| HR04| Bitwise Operations | Technical | TBI|
| HR05| The data should not be lost during failure | Scenario | FUTURE|
| HR06| The undo and redo operations of the operators used| Scenario | FUTURE|
| HR07| Trignometric operations have a good scope | Technical | FUTURE|
| HR08| Answer can be viewed either in decimal or p/q form | Technical | FUTURE|

## Low Level Requirements

|ID | Description | HRID | Status|
|---|-------------|------|-------|
|LR01| For each set of numbers the arthimetic,relational,factorial,max,min operators are performed and exact output is retrieved.| HR01 | TBI|
|LR02| Each operation has a different methos so that it is easy to understand and implement.| HR02| TBI|
|LR03| Each instruction is given clearly to perform the required operations.| HR03| TBI|
|LR04| The user can perform as many operations as needed untill they require and exit once they are done with the calculations.| HR04|TBI|
|LR05| The data should not be lost if a failure occurs |HR06|FUTURE|
|LR06| The undo and redo operations help lo check them what operations has been performed previuosly.|HR07|FUTURE|
|LR07| Trignometric calculations will be of a big use calculations will be very easy.|HR08|FUTURE|
|LR08| For operations of division and trignometric operations answer should be dispalyed either in decimal or p/q form.|HR08|FUTURE|
